Part 3 Questions:

1. No, because a message feature has several different components to it (read receipts, delivery, message formatting, etc.) and unit tests are more for small scale parts. If we use a unit test for messaging, we would not be able to test how the individual components of the feature interact with each other.

2. Yes, because it is an individual feature that is small with no other dependencies.
